# GNN_implementation-Link-Prediction
 A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a deep learning model designed to operate on graph-structured data. It has gained significant attention in recent years due to its effectiveness in a wide range of applications involving structured data.Here I implement Link Prediction on Protein dataset using message passing layers.
